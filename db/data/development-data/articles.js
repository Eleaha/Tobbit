But my time spent using React has given me some insight into when and why it might be appropriate to use another technology — Redux (a variant of the Flux architecture).",

Express.js and Node.js gave JavaScript newfound back-end functionality—allowing developers to build software with JavaScript on the server side for the first time. Together, they make it possible to build an entire site with JavaScript: You can develop server-side applications with Node.js and then publish those Node.js apps as websites with Express. Because Node.js itself wasn’t intended to build websites, the Express framework is able to layer in built-in structure and functions needed to actually build a site. It’s a pretty lightweight framework that’s great for giving developers extra, built-in web application features and the Express API without overriding the already robust, feature-packed Node.js platform. In short, Express and Node are changing the way developers build websites.",

    topic: "coding",
    author: "cooljmessy",
    body: "When designing an application that will communicate with a remote computer, a data format and exchange protocol must be selected. There are a variety of open, standardized options, and the ideal choice depends on the applications requirements and pre-existing functionality. For example, SOAP-based web services format the data in an XML payload wrapped within a SOAP envelope. While XML works well for many application scenarios, it has some drawbacks that make it less than ideal for others. One such space where XML is often less than ideal is with Ajax-style web applications. Ajax is a technique used for building interactive web applications that provide a snappier user experience through the use of out-of-band, lightweight calls to the web server in lieu of full-page postbacks. These asynchronous calls are initiated on the client using JavaScript and involve formatting data, sending it to a web server, and parsing and working with the returned data. While most browsers can construct, send, and parse XML, JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) provides a standardized data exchange format that is better-suited for Ajax-style web applications. JSON is an open, text-based data exchange format (see RFC 4627). Like XML, it is human-readable, platform independent, and enjoys a wide availability of implementations. Data formatted according to the JSON standard is lightweight and can be parsed by JavaScript implementations with incredible ease, making it an ideal data exchange format for Ajax web applications. Since it is primarily a data format, JSON is not limited to just Ajax web applications, and can be used in virtually any scenario where applications need to exchange or store structured information as text. This article examines the JSON standard, its relationship to JavaScript, and how it compares to XML. Jayrock, an open-source JSON implementation for .NET, is discussed and examples of creating and parsing JSON messages are provided in JavaScript and C#.",

I was an advocate of Big Sam’s appointment because of the fact he managed down the league and could see that talent lay beyond just the big clubs in the country. Roy had many faults but the biggest frustration for me was he failed to utilise an already diminished pool of English players by continuing to pick the so called elite players – who are all tainted with failure. To be fair to Allardyce his first England game came so early in the season that it made making whole sale changes difficult. We shall never know if he would have picked different players. Since he left the job it was up to Gareth Southgate to take on the mantle and again hope arose that he may start to pick some of the talented under 21s that he has worked with over the last five years.",

    body: "The history of Futbol Club Barcelona goes from the football club's founding in 1899 and up to current time. FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed ten UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2016, Barcelona has never been relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and arch-rival Real Madrid. The history of Barcelona has often been politically. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.",

Their work has helped develop stats that capture the value of players who don’t score many goals, but who set them up with pinpoint passing and hustle.

I’m going to see if it is possible define the intensity of a press with the use of numbers, more specifically by using some of the events that Opta record. Why would anyone want to do this? Well, for pretty much the same reason that we undertake any analytics study. If we can develop an objective scale which measures the intensity of a press then coaches can quickly see at a glance the strength, or otherwise, of the high pressing that their opposition has utilised in recent games. Teams or fans can also assess how much pressure their team exerted on the opposition in deep positions, and who knows, perhaps in time we will be able to assess the effectiveness that individual players have on the ability of their team to press. In essence we can take what is otherwise a subjective description and reduce it to one number so that it allows for comparison, analysis and ranking, if so desired.",

    body: "At lunchtime on the day of the Champions League final in 2012, Chelsea’s manager Roberto Di Matteo had selected 10 of his 11 players. He just didn’t know who to play in left midfield. The player would have to combat Bayern Munich’s brilliant Arjen Robben and Philipp Lahm. Going into the last team meeting, Di Matteo had a private chat with his left-back, Ashley Cole. He outlined the situation, then asked Cole who he would play at left-midfield. Instead of naming a seasoned star, Cole said: “Ryan Bertrand.” The 22-year-old reserve Bertrand had never played in the Champions League, let alone in club football’s biggest game. “Why?” asked Di Matteo, surprised. “I trust him,” replied Cole. Bertrand played well, and Chelsea beat Bayern on penalties. In part, this was a victory for talent management. Di Matteo had put aside his ego, and let trust between two players drive the decision. Talent management has been a business obsession at least since 1997, when the consultancy McKinsey identified a “war for talent”. The most visible battleground of this “war” is team sport. Football, in particular, is “the quintessential model for modern-day talent-dependent business”, writes Chris Brady, professor at Salford Business School. Big football clubs pay more than half their revenues to between 3 and 7 per cent of their workforce: the players. These young men are rich, multinational, mobile, often equipped with large egos and therefore hard to manage. Football managers are, above all, talent managers.",

Imagine a world where presenting a platter of seasonal vegetables inspires the same amount of cooing that the turkey does. Welcome to the world of twice-baked butternut squash. Sure, you could just roast some squash wedges and call it a day. But where's the fun in that? To make this year's most impressive vegetable side, Epi's food director Rhoda Boone gave super-seasonal butternut squash the twice-baked potatoes treatment: Mash the inside of the vegetable with butter, cream, and anything else that might make it more delicious, then pile it back into the vegetable, bake it until golden and velvety. The result is a jaw-dropping, brightly colored sweet-meet-savory butternut squash side dish. Here are just a few more reasons this creation belongs on this year's Thanksgiving table:",

Although fish fraud is common early in the supply chain, most of it comes at the retail level. In 65% of cases, the motivation is economic—slippery restaurateurs frequently serve up cheaper fish than they advertise to cut costs. In America, Oceana has reported instances of tilapia being sold as the more expensive red snapper. Especially brazen fish criminals have invented new types of fish entirely. In Brazil, researchers were puzzled to find markets selling 'douradinha', ' non-existent species. Close inspection found that 60% of such fish were actually 'vulture' catfish, a relatively undesirable dish.

    There stands a man both wise and kind,
    With vision bold and strategies bright,
    Eric ten Hag, a beacon of light.
    
    From Haaksbergen he did arise,
    A coach with fire in his eyes,
    His playing days were but a prelude,
    To a managerial path pursued.
    
    With Twente's youth, he honed his craft,
    Unveiling talents, making them laugh,
    He saw the spark in every soul,
    And nurtured them to reach their goal.
    
    Then came the call from Ajax's door,
    A chance to reshape and to restore,
    A sleeping giant poised to rise,
    Under ten Hag's enlightened guise.
    
    His philosophy, a work of art,
    Possession, movement, playing smart,
    A symphony of passes danced,
    As Ajax's prowess was enhanced.
    
    The pitch became his chessboard vast,
    Each player moving, shadows cast,
    With precision and calculated might,
    Ten Hag orchestrated their footballing flight.
    
    From the back they built their dream,
    With pressing high, they'd make teams scream,
    Fluid movement, a joyful ballet,
    As Ajax's brilliance came to play.
    
    Champions they rose in Dutch terrain,
    Their dominance, a joyous reign,
    The Eredivisie their rightful throne,
    Eric ten Hag, a leader known.
    
    But it was Europe where he'd truly shine,
    Challenging giants, weaving a line,
    With courage and belief, they'd soar,
    In the Champions League, they'd explore.
    
    A fearless march against the odds,
    The footballing world in awe applauds,
    With ten Hag's guidance, they'd dare to roam,
    The young and talented, finding home.
    
    In battles fierce, they etched their name,
    Defying history, fortune's game,
    A testament to ten Hag's command,
    That Ajax's spirit forever will stand.
    
    So let us sing a song of praise,
    For Eric ten Hag's guiding ways,
    A mastermind, a football sage,
    Whose brilliance sets the pitch ablaze.`,

The shift from traditional television networks to streaming services has empowered audiences to binge-watch entire seasons in one go, leading to a dramatic shift in how TV series are created and consumed. As a result, television networks have had to adjust their strategies to remain competitive.\n\nStreaming platforms also have a unique ability to tailor content to specific audiences using data analytics. By analyzing viewing habits, they can recommend shows that align with a viewer's interests, creating a more personalized experience. This level of customization has contributed to the success of shows that might not have gained traction on traditional networks. As the industry continues to evolve, it's likely that even more innovative models for content delivery will emerge, further reshaping the TV landscape.",

Regions that once experienced mild winters are now facing record-breaking cold temperatures, while other areas are dealing with more frequent heatwaves and droughts. These extreme shifts are not only influencing the global climate but also impacting ecosystems, agriculture, and human life. Farmers are seeing unpredictable harvests, and coastal cities are facing rising sea levels that threaten infrastructure. Scientists warn that without concerted global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, these patterns will only worsen.\n\nThe increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, has highlighted the urgency of addressing climate change. Countries around the world are investing in renewable energy solutions, improving disaster response strategies, and implementing policies aimed at reducing environmental impact. However, these efforts need to be scaled up to mitigate the risks of further climate disruption.

Today, meteorologists rely on a combination of satellite data, weather balloons, radar systems, and sophisticated computer models to predict weather patterns with increasing accuracy. The advent of high-powered supercomputers has revolutionized the way forecasts are made, allowing meteorologists to simulate and predict weather events far in advance. These technological advances have made it possible to provide early warnings for severe weather, saving lives and minimizing property damage.\n\nHowever, despite the improvements in forecasting, predicting the weather remains an inherently difficult task. The complexity of weather systems means that even the most advanced models can only predict weather with limited certainty beyond a few days. Meteorologists continue to refine their methods and incorporate more real-time data to improve forecasts, but as weather is influenced by many dynamic factors, some degree of unpredictability will always remain. The key is to continue advancing technology and improving our understanding of climate and weather systems to better prepare for future events.",

As travel trends evolve, more people are seeking immersive experiences that connect them with local traditions and nature. Whether you're a thrill-seeker, history buff, or beach lover, 2025 promises a wealth of travel opportunities for every type of explorer.",

They also offer affection on their own terms, making them a perfect companion for someone with a tight schedule. No matter the pet you choose, it's important to ensure that you can meet their basic needs and provide them with a safe and comfortable environment. With the right pet, even the busiest person can enjoy the companionship and joy that animals bring into our lives.",

    "body": "Esports, or competitive gaming, has rapidly transformed from a niche hobby to a global industry worth billions of dollars. What was once limited to local tournaments and basement LAN parties is now a multi-billion-dollar industry with millions of fans tuning in to watch professional players compete at the highest level.
